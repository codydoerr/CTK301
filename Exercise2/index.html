        <h2>Cody Doerr</h2>
            <p>In fields where nothing grew but weeds<br>
I found a flower at my feet<br>
Bending there in my direction<br>
I wrapped a hand around its stem<br>
I pulled until the roots gave in<br>
Finding now what I've been missing</p>
        <h2>Ifeanyi Ozonwankwo</h2>
        <p>  been starving for this long<br>
Keep the plate, I'll wait for the feast<br>
Watch them eat in front of me, don't act like I ain't want a piece</p>
        <h2>Aizhan Kurmanalieva</h2>
        <p> No pain, no gain </p>
